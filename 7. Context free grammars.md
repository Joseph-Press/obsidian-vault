## 7.1 Basic Notions

example CFG 

Σ1= {a,b}   <- terminals
V = {S,A,B}   <- vars/nonterminals 

_substitution rules_
~~~
S-> A
S-> B
A-> aA
A->ε
B->bBa
B->ε
~~~

A derivation:
S-> A           rule 1
   -> aAb      rule 3
   -> aaAbb  rule 3
   -> aaaAbbb  rule 3
   -> aaabbb rule 4

(continue deriving until no more variables)


Def: 
the lang of a grammar G is the set of all strings that can be derived


ex: 
S - > A|B  (pipe operater is short for alternation btw so its S -> A   S-> B)
A - > aAb | ε
B - > bBa | ε

Lang: 
{a^n b^n: n>= 0} u 
{b^n a^n: n>= 0}

Def A grammar is a tuple 
(V,Σ,R,S)
where 
V = set of vars (finite nonempty)
Σ = set of terminals 
R = set of rules 
S = start variable
