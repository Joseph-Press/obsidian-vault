Example: There’s a big bag of treats with orange and black
wrappers, some are chocolate inside and some are licorice:

|           | Orange | Black | Total |
| --------- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| Chocolate | 8      | 2     | 10    |
| Liquorice | 5      | 15    | 20    |
| Total     | 13     | 17    | 30    |

Suppose you sample a random treat (or trick!) from the bag:
1. What is the probability that you get a chocolate?
	- P(C) = 1/3 
2. What is prob of chocolate if the candy wrapper is orange?
	- P(C|O) (prob of choco given wrapper is orange) = 8/13
3. Can you write this in terms of prob. of chocolate and orange?
	- P(C∩O)=8/30 = 4/15
