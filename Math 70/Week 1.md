1. flipping hair coin 3 times wht are the ods of getting exactly 2 heads HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT, 3/8
    
2. suppose you see the first flip is heads, what is the updated probablity of getting exactly two heads among the three flips? H | TH HT TT HH 2/4=1/2
    
3. suppose you cant observe the experiment directly but are told that there were two heads in total. what is your updated assessment of the probblity that the first flip was heads? 2/3
    

sample space = set of all possible outcomes S

so S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT} S is the sample space ( )

s ∈ S are outcomes , while we call A ⊂ S events ![[Pasted image 20250929144315.png]] We consider a funciton P : {A ⊂S } -> [0,1] which assisgns to each event A the probablitiy P(A) that it occurs

P satisfies some natural properities like P(A⊔B) = P(A) + P(B) just as we assumed in our calculation to answer q 1 P(A)=3/8 P(THH ⊔HTH⊔HHT)= P(THH)+P(HTH)+P(HHT)= 1/8+1/8+1/8 = 3/8
