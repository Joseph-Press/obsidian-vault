Set: collection of objects 
eg 
- {1,2,5}
- {x∈Z|2|x}=even numbers 
- N ⊆ Z ⊆ Q 
⊆ = subset
∈ = is an element of

## Subset
Given two sets S1, S2 S1 is a subset of S2 if all objects in S1 are also objects of S2

S1 ⊆ S1 
object x is contrained in S1 if x is an object of S1 

x ∈ S1 

Prob space is (S, P)
S is a set called sample space and P is a real vauled set funciton S called the prob function 
P assignes E subset S
