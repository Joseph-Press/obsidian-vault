## 8.1 Introduction to Pushdown Automata (PDA)

- A **PDA** is like an NFA (nondeterministic finite automaton) **plus a stack**.
    
- You still read one input symbol at a time and update the current state like an NFA, but now:
    
    - You can also **push to** or **pop from** the stack.
        
    - The stack acts as **unbounded memory** (like infinite paper plates).
        
    - You **only interact with the top** of the stack (LIFO - last in, first out).
        

### PDA Components:

- Input alphabet `Σ` (same as the language you're processing)
    
- Stack alphabet `Γ` (can include terminals, variables, and special symbols)
    
- Set of states `Q`
    
- Transition function `δ`
    
- Start state `q₀`
    
- Accept states `F`
    

### Transitions Look Like:

Each transition is labeled with **three parts**:

1. **Input symbol to read** (or `ε` for none)
    
2. **Stack symbol to pop** (or `ε` for none)
    
3. **Stack symbol(s) to push** (or `ε` for none)
    

Example label:  
`a, A → ε`  
Means: if input is `a` and top of stack is `A`, pop `A`, read `a`, and push nothing.

### Important Insight:

- PDAs can solve problems **NFAs can’t**, like `{aⁿbⁿ}` or palindromes.
    
- Stack gives **memory** that allows for nested structure tracking (like matching counts).

## 8.2 Examples and Intuition

### Example: PDA for `{aⁿbⁿ}`

1. Start with empty stack
    
2. Push a bottom marker (⊥)
    
3. While reading `a`, **push `A`** for each
    
4. On switching to `b`, for each `b`, **pop `A`**
    
5. Accept if:
    - All `a`s and `b`s matched
        
    - Input is finished
        
    - Stack has only ⊥ left (then pop it and enter accept state)
        

### Stack Analogy: Bank Account

- Reading an `a`: deposit $1 (push `A`)
    
- Reading a `b`: withdraw $1 (pop `A`)
    
- You must have deposited enough to withdraw – no overdraft.
    

### Non-determinism

- Used to:
    
    - Guess midpoint (for palindromes)
        
    - Switch between stack-building and stack-unwinding
        
    - Decide when to end input reading
        
- PDAs accept strings as long as **any one computational path** leads to acceptance.
    

### Even-Length Palindromes

- Push each symbol during the first half
    
- At midpoint, switch and match each popped symbol with incoming input
    
- Accept when stack is back to bottom marker and input is done
    

### Odd-Length Palindromes

- Same idea, but **ignore the middle symbol**
    
- Non-deterministically decide when midpoint is reached, then continue popping
    

### More Intuition

- Stack stores structure (e.g., how many a's we’ve seen)
    
- Accept if input consumed and stack emptied properly

Thrm

Every lang that has a CFG can be recognized by a PDA

proof
given grammar 
(V, Σ' S, R)

PDA:
input alphabet :Σ

stack alphabet : V U Σ U {⊥}

## 8.4 Converting a PDA to a CFG 

Canonical Form

1) unique accept state 
![[Drawing 2025-05-07 14.47.22.excalidraw]]

2) PDA alway empties stack before accepting
![[Drawing 2025-05-07 14.49.59.excalidraw]]
3) Every transition is either a push or a pop (not both)
![[Drawing 2025-05-07 15.14.37.excalidraw]]

THRM 
If L is recognized by a PDA then L has a CFG

proof we'll asssume 1-2 above 
PDA: (Q, Σ,Γ,δm qstart, {qfinal})

for any P->Q define
Lp,q = {w: w can take the PDA from state p with empty stack to state q with empty stack}

L = L qstart, qfinal

Grammar:
- vars Vp,q for all p,q ∈ Q 
- alphabet Σ
- start symbol: V qstart, qfinal
- rules: 
	- Base case Vqq -> ε    ∀ q ∈ Q 
	- inductive step
- stack empty at some intermediate point 

![[Drawing 2025-05-07 15.33.06.excalidraw]]
 Vp,q -> Vp,r Vr,q
for all p,r,q ∈ Q


#### stack only empty at beginning + eng

Vpq -> σVr,s σ'

∀ p,q,r,s ∈ Q 
∀ σ,σ' ∈ Σ{u}{ε}
∀ γ ∈ Γ 

**δ**(p,σ,ε) ∃ (r, γ)
**δ**(s,σ',γ) ∃ (q,ε)

## 8.5 summary

thrm a lang L has a CFG iff L has a PDA

Def a lang L is called context free if L has a CFG (or equiv a PDA)

for every reg lang is context free 
pf 1) hw

we know context free lanauges are those that have a pda, nfas are just a tpye of pda

pf an NFA is a pda that does use its stack
