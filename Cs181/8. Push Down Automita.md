Thrm

Every lang that has a CFG can be recognized by a PDA

proof
given grammar 
(V, Σ' S, R)

PDA:
input alphabet :Σ

stack alphabet : V U Σ U {⊥}

## 8.4 Converting a PDA to a CFG 

Canonical Form

1) unique accept state 
![[Drawing 2025-05-07 14.47.22.excalidraw]]

2) PDA alway empties stack before accepting
![[Drawing 2025-05-07 14.49.59.excalidraw]]
3) Every transition is either a push or a pop (not both)

THRM 
If L is recognized by a PDA then L has a CFG

proof we'll asssume 1-2 above 
PDA: (Q, Σ,Γ,δm qstart, {qfinal})

for any P->Q define
Lp,q = {w: w can take the PDA from state p with empty stack to state q with empty stack}

L = L qstart, qfinal

Grammar:
- vars Vp,q for all p,q ∈ Q 
- alphabet Σ
- start symbol: V qstart, qfinal
- rules: 
	- Base case Vqq -> ε    ∀ q ∈ Q 
	- inductive step
- stack empty at some intermediate point
