# 2.1 basic notions

steps: 
- choose an alphabet : {a,b}
- draw states
- choose start state
- choose accept states
- draw transitions
	- a state may have 0 or 1 or 2 ... transitions on a given symbol
	- may have transitions on empty (ε)

NFA accepts w if and only if there is at least one path to an accepted state

| input  | path       | output |
| ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| ε      | -          | reject |
| 0      | -          | reject |
| 1      | -          | reject |
| 010110 | AABCDDD    | accept |
| 010    | a->a->b->c | reject |
# 2.2 using shortcuts 

ex: ∅
![[Drawing 2025-04-02 15.30.14.excalidraw]]
ex: {ε}
![[Drawing 2025-04-02 15.30.38.excalidraw]]
ex: {w: w doesnt contain a 1}
![[Drawing 2025-04-02 15.32.49.excalidraw]]
ex: {w: |w| >= 2 and w stays starts and ends with a 0}

# 2.3 pattern matching 

alphabet = {0,1 }

ex { wi contains 0101}

# 2.4 alternatives 
ex {w: |w| is divisible by 2 or by 3}

or is the operative word here ( can split lang into 2 langs that are easier to understand and combine solutions for complete solution)

# 2.4 continued

ex: {w: w contains an even # of 0s or exactly two 1s}

decompose into two simpler problems bc of the or

# 2.5 formal definitions
Def: An NFA is a tuple  (Q,Σ,δ,q0,F)  where 
-  **Q**: A finite set of states (nonempty + finite).
    
- **Σ**: A finite set of symbols, known as the alphabet (nonempty, finite).
    
- **q0**: The start state, where q0∈Q
    
- **F**: The set of accepting (or final) states, where F⊆Q
  
  so far the same as dfas ^

- **δ**: The transition function,
	- chat gpt addition mapping each state and input symbol pair to a single next state. Formally, δ:Q×Σ→Q This means that for every state q∈Q and input symbol a∈Σ, δ(q,a) specifies the next state. 
	- in class δ: Q×( Σ union {ε}) -> Q 
		- epsilon isnt a set its an element
		- Q current state
		- ( Σ union {ε}) what we're transitioning on
		- -> Q next state s()
			- but Q here is incorrect it's actually 𝒫(Q) (powerset of Q is next state)
	𝒫(({1,2,3})={∅,{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}

ex:

({A,B,C,D}), {0,1},**δ**,A,{D}}
A is start state D is end sates 
**δ**:

|     | 0   | 1     | ε                     |
| --- | --- | ----- | --------------------- |
| A   | {A} | {A,B} | ∅ or actually {A}     |
| B   | {C} | ∅     | {C} or actually {B,C} |
| C   | ∅   | {D}   | ∅ or actually {C}     |
| D   | {D} | {D}   | ∅ or actually {D}     |

Ex:
({A,B,C}, {0,1},**δ**,A,{B})

|     | 0   | 1     | ε   |
| --- | --- | ----- | --- |
| A   | {C} | {B}   | ∅   |
| B   | {A} | ∅     | ∅   |
| C   | {B} | {B,C} | {A} |

Def: NFA N=(Q,Σ,δ,q0,F) recognizes the lang L if and only if L = {w: N accepts w} 
	recognizes is poor term according to prof, computes might be better word
