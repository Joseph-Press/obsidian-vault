w: # of 1's in w == i (mod 3) 

is {w N(w,1) = 3k+1 for some k >= 1}

n(w,1 ) means that when you divide this quantity by 3 theres a remainder of 1 


n(w,1)%3 = 1

# DFAs are forgetful

show that any dfa w/ n states (say) must visit soem state at least twice when it consumes an input of length >= n 

any dfa M with n states with the property that it accepts some strings must accept infinitely many states
