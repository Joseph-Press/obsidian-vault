Does this NFA accept 0110
- thought processes, A,C,C,A,B,C,A
- on each search problem the q is is there an accepting computation of the form 

Œµ..Œµ|0Œµ..Œµ|1Œµ..Œµ|1Œµ..Œµ|0Œµ..Œµ|
>=0  for each set of Œµ's

## conversion to DFA
Step 1:
![[Drawing 2025-04-07 15.15.14.excalidraw]]

circled ones are accepted as they contain A

work is done after leaving B as weres no way to return to a B 

if AB one is starting then BC 

Step2: cleanup

red = unreachable so it is eliminated 

mathmatically unsatisfiable though, need to prove it broader

## 3.2 General Theorem

Theory for every NFA N, there is a DFA D  that recognizes the same language.

Proof: 
	Given NFA: 
	(Q,Œ£,Œ¥,q0,F)
Define DFA 
	D = ( ùí´(Q), Œ£, Œî, S0, ‚Ñ±) 
- Œî not Œ¥ for some reason about largeness or something i missed it*
- ‚Ñ± is an F
S0 = {q ‚àà Q: q is reachable from q0 via a path { Œµ..Œµ}

Œî(S, œÉ) = {q‚àà Q: q is reachable from a state in S via a path œÉŒµŒµ..Œµ}
	- in plain english:  **Œî(S, œÉ)** is the set of all states you can get to by starting in any state from the set S, taking a step on the  œÉ, and then following as many Œµ-transitions as you want after that.

‚Ñ± = {S<= Q: S **‚à©** F =/= ‚àÖ}
	 S has nonempty intersection with F 
N accepts w=w1w2..wn
= a state in F is reachable from q0 via a path Œµ..Œµ|w1Œµ..Œµ|w2Œµ..Œµ|w2Œµ..Œµ ...| wnŒµ..Œµ|

= a state in ‚Ñ± is reachable in DFA from S0 

= D accepts w via the path w1 w2 w3 ... wn 


Def a language L is called regular iff some NFA recognizes L. 

test


# 3.3  optimality
def Let n = positive integer then there exists (‚àÉ) lan Ln s.t: 
	(a) Ln ahs an NFA of size n+1 
	(b) Lb has no DFA of size Ln

Def Define Ln = { w: w has a 0 in the nth pos'n from end}

Œ£1 = {0,1}

1+ (n-1) +1 = n+1 states
