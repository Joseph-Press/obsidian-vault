# 1.1 Basic notions
#### `alphabet`
 Definition: an alphabet is any finite nonempty set of symbols 
ex: {0,1} or {a,b,c,d,...,z}, {+,-,x,/}

#### `string`
def: a `string` is any finite sequence of symbols from a given alphabet 
ex: theory, abracadabra, 0111010, 1100000, ++++, -+//, ∅

#### `lang` 
a `lang` is any set of strings over a given alphabet 
ex: 
- {acclaim, aim,brim, claim, demin, dim, ...}
- {ε}
- {} =∅ (empty lang)
--- the ones above were finite, the ones below aren't
- {0,1,00,11,000,111,0000,...}
- {ε,0,00,11,011,101,110,...}

#### `computational device`
a computational device is any mechanism that inputs a string and accepts or rejects it

# 1.2 deterministic finite automaton 
(pl. automata)

- choose alphabet
- draw states 
- choose start state
- choose accept state
- draw transitions

| input | output |
| ----- | ------ |
| ε     | rej    |
| ab    | rej    |
| aaa   | accept |
| abb   | accept |
|       |        |
def the lang of a DFA is the set of string s it accepts

alphabet ={a,b}

lang ={w:  first letter of alphabet}

#### 1.3 designing dfa's 

alphabet = {0,1}
ex ∅
![[Drawing 2025-04-02 14.13.25.excalidraw]]
ex {w:every odd pos'n is a 1}
![[Drawing 2025-04-02 14.19.57.excalidraw]]
ex: {w: w ends with 0}
![[Drawing 2025-04-02 14.21.46.excalidraw]]

ex: {w: w begins with 1, ends with 0}
![[Drawing 2025-04-02 14.26.39.excalidraw]]
ex:{w: /w/ >=4}
![[Drawing 2025-04-02 14.30.47.excalidraw]]

ex: {w:/w/ divisible by 1000}
![[Drawing 2025-04-02 14.33.24.excalidraw]]

ex: {w: w contains 0101}

### 1.4 formal definitions 

def: a DFA is a tuple ( Q, sigma, delta, etc)

Q = set of states (finite, xxx (fill in idk what it says ))

Σ = alphabet 

δ = transision fn

q0 = start state 

F = set of accept states 


**Definition**: A _Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)_ is defined as a 5-tuple (Q,Σ,δ,q0,F):

- **Q: A finite set of states.
    
- **Σ**: A finite set of symbols, known as the alphabet.
    
- **δ**: The transition function, mapping each state and input symbol pair to a single next state. Formally, δ:Q×Σ→Q This means that for every state q∈Q and input symbol a∈Σ, δ(q,a) specifies the next state. 
    
- **q0**: The initial state, where q0∈Q
    
- **F**: The set of accepting (or final) states, where F⊆Q
