break down into simpler problems, solve these problems and invoke (envoke?) closure property. 
(side note for future, i forgot my glasses so relied on pics for notes lol)

## 4.1 Complement operation 

complement of a set

s bar = { x: x ∉ s}

then L regular -> Lbar regular

(in the past we had 


ex: {w: w contains 0101}

![[Drawing 2025-04-02 14.34.59.excalidraw]]

but this is the negative of that )![[IMG_9934.jpg]]


## 4.2 union + intersection

### cartesian product construction (really important!!!)

### closure recap 
regular langs are closed under a given operation if applying that operation to reg languages always results in a regular language 

L' ⊕ L" = (L'∩L" )∪(L"∩ L'_ )

# 4.3 set difference 
![[Drawing 2025-04-14 14.14.15.excalidraw]]

L', L" = {w ∈ L'; w ∉ L"}

then L', L" reg => L' \ L" reg.

proof L'\L'' = L' ∩ L"

![[Drawing 2025-04-14 14.17.05.excalidraw]]

Prob: If L', L'' regular so is L = {w∈ L': no substring of w is in L'' }


reworded 

if A, B regular so is L = {w∈ A: no substring of w is in B}

A = available
B = bad

for instance at DMV A is valid allowed licesne plates and B are taken or no allowed 

B' = strings that contain a substring in B
