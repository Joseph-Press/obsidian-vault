break down into simpler problems, solve these problems and invoke (envoke?) closure property. 
(side note for future, i forgot my glasses so relied on pics for notes lol)

## 4.1 Complement operation 

complement of a set 
![[Drawing 2025-04-09 14.50.30.excalidraw]]

s bar = { x: x ∉ s}

then L regular -> Lbar regular 

![[IMG_9932.jpg]]![[IMG_9933.jpg]]

(in the past we had 


ex: {w: w contains 0101}

![[Drawing 2025-04-02 14.34.59.excalidraw]]

but this is the negative of that )![[IMG_9934.jpg]]


## 4.2 union + intersection

### cartesian product construction (really important!!!)

### closure recap 
regular langs are closed under a given operation if applying that operation to reg languages always results in a regular language 

L' ⊕ L" = (L'∩L" )∪(L"∩ L'_ )

# 4.3 set difference 
![[Drawing 2025-04-14 14.14.15.excalidraw]]

L', L" = {w ∈ L'; w ∉ L"}

then L', L" reg => L' \ L" reg.

proof L'\L'' = L' ∩ L"

![[Drawing 2025-04-14 14.17.05.excalidraw]]

Prob: If L', L'' regular so is L = {w∈ L': no substring of w is in L'' }


reworded 

if A, B regular so is L = {w∈ A: no substring of w is in B}

A = available
B = bad

for instance at DMV A is valid allowed licesne plates and B are taken or no allowed 

B' = strings that contain a substring in B 

![[Drawing 2025-04-14 14.23.09.excalidraw]]

we added the start state outside of the cloud to allow us to remove prefixes 
nfa for B  in black 

nfa for B' in red



## 4.4 concatenation 

Def: 
L' L" = { w' w ": w' ∈L'., w'' ∈ L'' }

(also denoted with a circle around L' L'' or L' (some symbol maybe a dot) L'')

ex L' {000,111} L'' = {10,010}
L' L'' {00010,000010, 11110, 111010}

ex  L ∅ = ∅
L {ε} = L 
∅ L = ∅
{ε} L = L 

therom 
L', L'' reg -> L' L'' 

![[Drawing 2025-04-14 14.36.35.excalidraw]]
add an  ε accept arrow from each accept state of first NFA to q''0

then make all states of first nfa reject 

![[Drawing 2025-04-14 14.42.00.excalidraw]]

ex L = { u v : } |u| add, v contains >= 2 zeros

![[Drawing 2025-04-14 14.45.46.excalidraw]]

## 4.3 Kleene star 

Def: 
`L*` = {w: w is the concatenation of ZERO or more strings in L}

Def 
L = {0,1}
`L*` = {ε,0,1,00,01,10,11,...} all binary strings 

Observation 
`∅*` = {ε}
`{ε}*` = {ε}

Observation: 
`L*` finite (=)
L = ∅ or L = {ε}

therom L reg => 
`L* `reg 

_incorrect proof_
`L*` = {ε} ∪ L ∪ LL ∪ LLL ∪ LLLL ∪... 

can say ε is reg, L is reg, LL is reg, LLL is ... 
!! may be nonregular because union is inifite !! 

Incorrect proof 
![[Drawing 2025-04-14 15.03.09.excalidraw]]
L = strings that end with 1 

![[Drawing 2025-04-14 15.07.40.excalidraw]]

accepts everything, which isnt `L*`

`L*` is not everything ! 

correct proof 
![[Drawing 2025-04-14 15.18.58.excalidraw]]


## 4.6 prefix + suffix

def 

prefix (L) = {u: u,v ∈L for some v} (heads) 
suffix (L) = {v: u,v, ∈L for some u} (tails) 

L reg => prefix (L) is reg 

if.f ![[Drawing 2025-04-14 15.29.14.excalidraw]]
(Q,Σ,δ,q0,F)

DFA for prefix (L):
(Q,Σ,δ,q0,F)

F' = {q∈Q : ∃ path from q to a state in F}

theorm 
L reg => suffix (L) reg. 
proof 

![[Drawing 2025-04-14 15.37.27.excalidraw]]

another proof
![[Drawing 2025-04-14 15.46.36.excalidraw]]

## 4.6 cont 

sunstring (L) ] {v:uv w∈L}for some strings u,w 

substring (L) = prefix(suffix(L))

## 4.7 reverse

for any w = w1 w2 ...wn

`W^r` = wn wn-1 ...w2 w1

Def L^R = {W^R: W∈L}

Ex {abc,011}^R
= {cba, 110}

then L reg => L^R reg.

transisitons: reuse all arrows 

start state: create new start state, 
link it with ε's to old accept states 


accept state q0

suffix(L) = (prefix(L^R))^R

![[Drawing 2025-04-16 14.42.32.excalidraw]]

## 4.8 add + skip 

Def: add(L) = { x σ y: σ∈Σ1}
xy ∈ L 

skip (L) = {xy: x σ y∈L} for some σ∈Σ

(triangle ! is on the whiteboard here) x,y are strings (possibly empty)

thrm L reg => add(L), skip(L) reg
